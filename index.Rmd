# Unlocking the Cycle
Not just a monthly event, menstruation is a critical, often-overlooked indicator that impacts the productivity, mental well-being, and overall health of hundreds of millions of menstruators globally. However, its symptoms often remain a complex, frustrating mystery. 

In this project, we seek to uncover the correlations driving common menstruation symptoms by applying advanced analytical techniques to comprehensive lifestyle datasets, including detailed records of sleep sessions, stress levels, physical activity, and hormone fluctuations. 

At its core, this project is dedicated to advancing the understanding and optimization of health for all menstruators through the power of data.
